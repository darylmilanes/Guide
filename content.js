    "His compassion for the poor, sick, and brokenhearted": {
      title: "His Compassion for the Poor, Sick, and Brokenhearted",
      verses: [
        "Matthew 9:35–36",
        "Luke 7:11–17",
        "Mark 1:40–42",
        "Matthew 14:13–14"
      ],
      scripture: `
Matthew 9:35–36 — Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When He saw the crowds, He had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

Luke 7:11–17 — Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and His disciples and a large crowd went along with Him. As He approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. When the Lord saw her, His heart went out to her and He said, “Don’t cry.” Then He went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!” The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. They were all filled with awe and praised God.

Mark 1:40–42 — A man with leprosy came to Him and begged Him on his knees, “If You are willing, You can make me clean.” Jesus was moved with compassion. He reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!” Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.

Matthew 14:13–14 — When Jesus heard what had happened, He withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed Him on foot from the towns. When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them and healed their sick.
      `,
      context: `
Throughout the Gospels, Jesus’ compassion is not theoretical. He doesn’t simply feel for the broken—He moves toward them. 
His compassion interrupts His plans, defies social boundaries, and transforms lives. 
The poor, the sick, the grieving—all find in Him not pity, but presence. 
He restores not only health, but dignity and hope.`,
      explanation: `
The compassion of Jesus is the clearest window into the heart of God. 
The word used for “compassion” in the Gospels, *splagchnizomai*, means “to be moved from the depths of one’s being.” 
This is divine empathy that stirs to action. In a world quick to avoid discomfort, Jesus shows that love begins when we refuse to look away.`,
      questions: [
        "What stirs compassion in your heart the way suffering moved Jesus?",
        "How can you respond to the needs around you with presence, not avoidance?",
        "Where have you personally experienced Christ’s compassion for you?"
      ],
      reflection: `
To see as Jesus sees is to move as Jesus moves. 
His compassion crosses boundaries—between the clean and unclean, the worthy and unworthy, the accepted and forgotten.`,
      reflectionQuote: "“True compassion imitates Christ — it sees, feels, and moves.”",
      prayer: `
Lord Jesus, soften my heart toward those who are suffering. 
Teach me to see need as You see it, not as a burden but as a chance to reveal Your mercy. 
Let my love be more than feeling—let it become movement. Amen.

    "Mercy toward sinners and the outcast (Zacchaeus, the adulterous woman)": {
      title: "Mercy Toward Sinners and the Outcast",
      verses: [
        "Luke 19:1–10",
        "John 8:1–11"
      ],
      scripture: `
Luke 19:5–10 — When Jesus reached the spot, He looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.” 
So he came down at once and welcomed Him gladly. 
All the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.” 
But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.” 
Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. 
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”

John 8:10–11 — Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” 
“No one, sir,” she said. 
“Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.”
      `,
      context: `
Both Zacchaeus and the adulterous woman stand on the margins of religious society—one by greed and corruption, the other by moral failure. 
Yet Jesus calls each by name, lifts their heads, and restores their humanity. 
He offers mercy before they even ask for it.`,
      explanation: `
Mercy does not deny sin—it defies its power to define a person. 
When Jesus forgives, He does not excuse; He redeems. 
The grace He gives invites repentance and transformation, not shame. 
Every act of mercy reveals a God who chooses restoration over rejection.`,
      questions: [
        "When have you felt judged instead of understood?",
        "How can you extend mercy to someone others might reject?",
        "Do you believe that forgiveness can bring freedom, not guilt?"
      ],
      reflection: `
Grace begins where condemnation ends. 
To meet the gaze of Jesus is to meet love that tells the truth and still chooses you.`,
      reflectionQuote: "“Mercy restores what sin has broken.”",
      prayer: `
Lord, thank You for mercy that meets me at my lowest and lifts me higher. 
Help me to see others not by their failures, but by Your redemptive hope. Amen.

    "Love for children and the overlooked": {
      title: "Love for Children and the Overlooked",
      verses: [
        "Mark 10:13–16",
        "Matthew 18:1–5"
      ],
      scripture: `
Mark 10:13–16 — People were bringing little children to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them. 
When Jesus saw this, He was indignant. He said to them, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 
Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.” 
And He took the children in His arms, placed His hands on them, and blessed them.

Matthew 18:1–5 — The disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 
He called a little child to Him, and placed the child among them. 
And He said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 
Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
And whoever welcomes one such child in My name welcomes Me.”
      `,
      context: `
In ancient society, children had no social standing. 
Yet Jesus not only welcomes them—He holds them up as models of faith. 
He teaches that greatness in the Kingdom is measured by humility and dependence.`,
      explanation: `
The love of Jesus overturns hierarchy. 
He honors those the world overlooks. 
To follow Him is to learn the freedom of childlike faith—trusting, joyful, and unguarded.`,
      questions: [
        "What does it mean for you to have childlike faith?",
        "Who are the “overlooked” in your life that Jesus might be asking you to welcome?",
        "When did you last approach God with the simplicity of a child?"
      ],
      reflection: `
God’s Kingdom belongs to the open-hearted. 
Childlike trust is not naïveté—it is clarity about who the Father is.`,
      reflectionQuote: "“The humble and childlike inherit the heart of the Kingdom.”",
      prayer: `
Father, teach me to trust You like a child again. 
Strip away cynicism and pride. 
Let my heart rest in the safety of Your arms. Amen.

    "His invitation: “Come to Me, all you who are weary…”": {
      title: "His Invitation: “Come to Me, All You Who Are Weary”",
      verses: ["Matthew 11:28–30"],
      scripture: `
Matthew 11:28–30 — “Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 
For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”
      `,
      context: `
Jesus offers an invitation, not a command. 
He speaks to the weary—those burdened by religion, guilt, fear, and endless striving. 
Unlike every other rabbi or ruler, He promises rest, not performance.`,
      explanation: `
This is the heartbeat of discipleship: to come, not to impress, but to receive. 
His “yoke” is not a new weight but a new way—partnership with a gentle Savior. 
Rest is not the absence of work, but the presence of Christ within it.`,
      questions: [
        "What burdens are you carrying that Christ invites you to lay down?",
        "How does His gentleness reshape your understanding of God?",
        "What might it look like to live from rest rather than striving?"
      ],
      reflection: `
To follow Jesus is not to escape life’s weight, but to discover that you are no longer carrying it alone.`,
      reflectionQuote: "“Rest is found not in release, but in relationship.”",
      prayer: `
Jesus, You call me to come. 
I bring You my exhaustion, my failures, and my striving. 
Teach me to rest in Your love and walk in Your strength. Amen.
      `
    }
